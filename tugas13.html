      <h1>A Brief History of Indonesia Until the Age of Seizing Independence</h1>
      <hr />
      <p><b>Jakarta</b> - <span style="color: orange;">Indonesian History</span> needs to be known. The name Indonesia itself was used for the first time at the Second Youth Congress on October 28, 1928. Long before that the area now called Indonesia was better known as Nusantara. Various kingdoms are in this archipelago.
        The Archipelago has almost never escaped colonization by foreign nations. Abundant natural resources are a target. The Portuguese in 1509 succeeded in controlling the areas of Malacca, Ternate and Madura. One of the resistances was from Fatahillah from Demak who succeeded in seizing Sunda Kelapa from the Portuguese in 1602.
        After the Portuguese, the Dutch then moved to the Banten area under the leadership of Cornelis de Houtman. At that time, the Dutch wanted to form a VOC and control Indonesian spices.In forming the VOC there were several agreements that the Dutch had to obey, such as the Bongaya agreement to the Giyanti agreement. After the VOC was dissolved, the Dutch finally appointed Herman William Daendels as governor general of the Dutch East Indies. During his time, he forced the people of Java to work to build the Anyer-Panarukan route.
        The Dutch controlled Indonesia for approximately 350 years. Until finally Japan entered Indonesia and attacked the Netherlands until it surrendered unconditionally. Japanese rule ended after 3.5 years of colonization and ended when the allied forces lost in World War II. In addition, two cities in Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were bombed by the allied forces.  
        Knowing that Japan had lost, a BPUPKI or Dokuritsu Junbi Cosakai body was formed which was chaired by Dr. Radjiman Widyodiningrat.
        After hearing about Japan's defeat on August 14, 1945, the younger group urged the older group to quickly carry out the proclamation of independence.
        In the <span style="color: orange;">history of Indonesia's</span> independence process, the Rengasdengklok incident occurred, namely the kidnapping of Soekarno and Hatta by young people to accelerate the implementation of the proclamation. 
        After returning to Jakarta, Soekarno and Hatta began compiling the text of the proclamation at Admiral Maeda's house and was assisted by Achmad Soebardjo and witnessed by Soekarno, BM, Diah, Sudiro and Sayuti Melik.    
        The text of the proclamation was finally read on August 17, 1945. The <span style="color: orange;">history of Indonesia</span> after independence was to ratify and establish the Constitution (UUD) as the foundation of the Republic of Indonesia which was finally known to the public as the 1945 Constitution.</p>

      <img src="images/presidensoekarno.jpg" alt="presidensoekarno" style="width: 200px;"/>
      <p>The first president of the Republic of Indonesia, Soekarno, who was usually called Bung Karno, was born in Surabaya, East Java, on June 6, 1901 and died in Jakarta on June 21, 1970.
        During his lifetime he had three wives and was blessed with eight children. He formulated the teachings of Marhaenism and founded the Indonesian National Party (PNI) with the goal of an independent Indonesia. As a result, the Dutch put him in Sukamiskin prison.
        Eight months later a new trial. In his defense, titled Indonesia Against the Law, Soekarno pointed out the apostasy of the Netherlands, a nation which at that time was more advanced than Indonesia.
        After going through a long struggle, Bung Karno and Bung Hatta proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Indonesia on August 17, 1945. In the PPKI meeting, August 18, 1945 Ir. Sukarno was elected by acclamation as the first President of the Republic of Indonesia.
        Soekarno's presidency period started from 1945 to 1966.</p>

        As a major general, Suharto made his way into the military which brought him into the political arena.
        Due to the deteriorating political situation after the outbreak of the G-30-S/PKI, at the March 1967 meeting, Suharto was officially appointed as the second President of Indonesia to replace Soekarno.
        Pak Harto ruled for more than three decades, passing six elections until he resigned on May 21, 1998.</p>
